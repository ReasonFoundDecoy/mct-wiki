# SensibleToolbox

{% hint style="warning" %}
A lot of this section was taken from: [https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/sensible-toolbox](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/sensible-toolbox/pages/) plugin page. Credits go to `desht` for original wiki creation.

We are merely providing an updated version of the wiki that players can use, without worry of some aspect of the plugin descriptions being wrong due to age.

Areas that are altered for MCTantrum will be noted in most cases.
