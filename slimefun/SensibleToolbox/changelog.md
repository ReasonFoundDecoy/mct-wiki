## July 12th, 2022
First update post 1.19 fix. Mostly some basic machine functions and simple fixes.
```
- Auto Farm fixed, re-enabled
- Auto Farm MKII fixed, re-enabled
- Infernal Farm fixed, re-enabled
- Netherite axes added as valid material to break STB machines/signs
- All Combine Hoes fixed, re-enabled (Thank you Sefiraat)
- 50k Battery box recipe changed to require Diamond instead of Gold ingot (upgraded machine, slight increased to cost). This makes the 50k Battery Box craftable again.
- Moisture checker's now properly display non-moisture'd blocks as black wool
- A few machines have been fixed to properly update energy after a server restart
