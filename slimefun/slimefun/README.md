# Slimefun

## This entire section is UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

The Slimefun portion of our wiki will contain detailed information about each item and other things relating to specifics on our server, such as disabled items and items/systems that work harmoniously between addons we have.

As a side note, all images here will be from the server resource pack. The [Slimefun portion](../../general/server-resource-pack/slimefun-textures.md) of the resource pack was done by RaulH22.

Until I complete this section, here are some places you can find general information:
