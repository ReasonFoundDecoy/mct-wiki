# Ranks

<mark style="color:green;">**All ranks are non-P2W!**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:green;">**Every player has the opportunity to reach the top.**</mark>

There are 16 normal ranks. In game, you can view the requirements and rewards for each one either at spawn or by running the command <mark style="color:blue;">**/ranks**</mark>.

To rank up, go to spawn and click on the rank heads. Ranks must be done in order, starting at Chicken as the first rank.
