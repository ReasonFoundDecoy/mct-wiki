# Default (new player)

When you join the server for the first time, you are rankless for a minimum of 2 hours (a playtime requirement for the first rank) and your name is gray with no prefix.

You start off with 1 available slot for a home set point.

Upon first join, you'll start off with a Welcome kit, consisting of custom named leather armor, a set of stone tools, a stone sword, 32 torches in your offhand, and 16 pieces of bread.
