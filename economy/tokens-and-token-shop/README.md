# Tokens and Tokenshop

## Tokens

Tokens are a virtual currency used for various things. You can earn tokens though the [Vote Crate](../crates/vote-crate/), doing daily quests, and sometimes through giveaways. Your token balance can be viewed on your quickboard.

You may consider buying or selling items for tokens instead of money. The only way to currently do this is by running the command <mark style="color:blue;">**/tokens send \<player> \<amount>**</mark>. This means that it's a trust trade since tokens cannot be exchanged via sign shops or auction house.

## Tokenshop <mark style="color:blue;">**(/tokenshop)**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp Tokenshop**</mark>

There are various types of currencies you can buy with your tokens by doing <mark style="color:blue;">**/tokenshop**</mark>. Use your currencies at <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp Tokenshop**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp**</mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">**FalloutShelter**</mark>](../../general/server-resource-pack/calamity/), or at the [Pokemon](../../general/server-resource-pack/pokemon/) store outside of spawn!
