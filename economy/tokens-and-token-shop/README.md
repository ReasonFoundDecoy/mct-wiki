# Tokens and Token Shop

## Tokens

Tokens are another currency used for various things. You can earn tokens though the [Vote Crate](../crates/vote-crate/), doing daily quests, and sometimes through giveaways. Your token balance can be viewed on your quickboard.

You may consider buying or selling items for tokens instead of money. The only way to currently do this is by running the command <mark style="color:blue;">**/tokens send \<player> \<amount>**</mark>. This means that it's a trust trade since tokens cannot be exchanged via sign shops or auction house.

## Token Shop <mark style="color:blue;">**(/tokenshop)**</mark>

There are 4 main categories in the Token Shop:

* Charms
* AE Items
* Custom Gear Vouchers
* â‚½okedollars

### Charms

Charms are items that give the player buffs while being held. Some charms require being either in the offhand or mainhand, and some can just be anywhere in your inventory.
