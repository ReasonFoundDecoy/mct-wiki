# Inventory Coupon

Since we have our Inactive Player Policy, we give back to the community through the use of Inventory Coupons.

Inventory Coupons essentially are a voucher you give to a server owner in exchange for the entire inventory of a player who has become inactive at some point during server's life.&#x20;

To redeem this voucher, simply contact ReasonFoundDecoy or B\_White, completely empty your whole inventory except for your Coupon, and receive your prizes!

Sometimes the inventories received are from players that were once really overpowered, some are not. The inventories are chosen at random.
