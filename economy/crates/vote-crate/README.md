# Vote Crate

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/vote crate.png>)

The Vote Crate is a virtual crate that you receive as a reward for voting. You get 1 for each site you vote on. To use, simply hold it in you hand and right-click in the air with it. There are 12 rewards inside and it drops 1 reward per crate opening.

There is a cooldown of only 1 second and it doesn't have any animations, making it easy for rapid opening.
