# Mystery Crate

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/mystery crate.png>)

The Mystery Crate is a physical crate located at spawn. It has a cooldown of 1 second. There are an unknown amount of items and unknown drop chances. We do know that there is junk but also very good items inside. There is a trashcan located adjacent to the crate for easy disposing of unwanted rewards.

Mystery Crate Keys drop from all hostile mobs and are fairly easy to obtain.
