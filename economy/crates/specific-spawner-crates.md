# Specific Spawner Crates

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/axolotl crate.png>)

Specific Spawner Crates are physical crates located at <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp Spawner\_Crates**</mark>. Permission to use them as well as warping there are gained at Wither rank.

These crates share an 8 hour cooldown. For example, if you open a Cat and still want to get an Elder Guardian, you won't be able to do so for 8 full hours. Your cooldown timer is located on your quickboard. Other people are allowed to use their cooldown to open a crate for you.

These keys are craftable! Please see "Bits, Heads, and Spawners" page for more info on crafting.

Each crate has 100% chance to drop 1 spawner.
