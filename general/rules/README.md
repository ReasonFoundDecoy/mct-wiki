# Rules

<mark style="color:purple;">**1.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No racism, bigotry, or sexual talk**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Just literally no racism, bigotry, or sexual talk - it's Minecraft.

<mark style="color:purple;">**2.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**Don't be toxic af, have respect**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> We want a healthy community where people can have a good time. Don't harrass anyone for any reason and treat others the way you'd want to be treated.

<mark style="color:purple;">**3.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:orange;">**Cussing is allowed but keep it chill**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Pretty self explanatory. If you call someone names or say 'fuck you' or whatever, you're going to get jailed or banned for breaking Rule 2.

<mark style="color:purple;">**4.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No advertising of any kind**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Just don't. Everyone on the planet has to see ads everywhere they go, let's not do that here.

<mark style="color:purple;">**5.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**Do not spam the chat**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Spamming the chat a few times will give a warning to stop doing it. If you keep doing it you get auto-banned. Spamming the chat also includes relogging and dying on purpose over and over again, etc.

<mark style="color:purple;">**6.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No cheaty clients or hacks**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> We're allowing players to use some clients. Let me be very clear: if you're caught using x-ray, flying, using kill-aura, or any other hacks your client might be capable of, you'll be jailed immediately or outright banned.

<mark style="color:purple;">**7.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No griefing, we'll getcha**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Griefing of the server, public warps, people, and/or their claims is not allowed. We'll find out who did it and when, so don't do it.

<mark style="color:purple;">**8.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:green;">**Basic auto-clickers are allowed**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> If you're not sure if you have a basic simple auto-clicker, ask B or Decoy to approve it. Other players have suggestions on which ones are good if you'd like to get one. If you keep getting kicked for sending too many packets, you'll be warned once to slow down your clicker. This directly ties in with Rule 5.

<mark style="color:purple;">**9.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:green;">**AFK farming is allowed**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> You won't get kicked for AFK and you're allowed to use your auto-clicker to AFK farm. AFK fish farms are ok as long as you're not using cheaty clients to do it, just make a vanilla one.

<mark style="color:purple;">**10.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:green;">**ONE alt account is allowed**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Let admin know who your alt account is (or we'll find out). Alts can play just like regular players (collect rewards, rank up, etc.)

<mark style="color:purple;">**11.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No Slimefun machines at spawn shops**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> This includes any machines, cargo, electricity, etc.; we don't want unnecessary lag at spawn.

<mark style="color:purple;">**12.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:red;">**No arbitrary warps; they need to have community benefit**</mark>** ** <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> Warps aren't to be used as a sethome, don't make empty boxes for "afk" warps so you can have players chunkload your stuff, etc. They need to benefit the whole community.

<mark style="color:purple;">**13.**</mark>**  **<mark style="color:orange;">**Use your head**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> This is one of those rules that means it's ultimately up to admin if you get punished for committing an offense that's not listed here.
