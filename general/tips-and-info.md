* The server's birthday is March 4, 2021.
* Restarts are daily at 6:00am EST.
* Maintenance is weekly, every Tuesday from 6:00am - 8:00am EST.

* PVP and explosions cannot happen while inside of a claim.
* Keep Inventory is turned on.
* You are automatically visible on DynMap on first join. Toggle with <mark style="color:blue;">**/hide**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**/show**</mark>.
* The HUD on the right side of your game screen is your quickboard. It has some important info usually found in F3 and some other helpful info relating to you. Toggle it on or off by typing <mark style="color:blue;">**/toggleqb**</mark>. The quickboard does act funny sometimes and it will disappear when you're in the nether or the end. Try coming back to spawn and toggling it and it should come back on.
* There's a 10% chance that you will drop 1% of your money if you're killed by another player! The PVP arena at spawn has this turned off by default.
* Villager trades are turned off to preserve healthy economy for enchantment books. Obtain enchantment books by fishing (fishing has been buffed) and enchantment table.

<summary>Plugin Specific</summary>

* McMMO does not register mobs killed from a spawner, so you cannot level up that way.
* Create elevator signs -the top line should read \[Elevator]. Place them vertically in line with each other for them to work. Right-click to go up and shift right-click to go down.
* If PVP is not working for you and a friend, double check that you're not in a party (mcmmo). Being in a party will stop the ability to harm each other.
* You can do up to 50 quests at a time.
* You can have up to 3 jobs at once.

<summary>General Gameplay</summary>

* Silk Touch books can be purchased for very cheap from the NPCs that live around the tree at spawn.
* Actually, check the NPCs out for other custom items too!
* You can sit on all slabs and stairs by right-clicking them.
* You start off with 100 claim blocks and earn 100 more per hour of playtime.
* It is good practice to name your tools, armor, or special items if they have default names. This is because clearlagg will **not** clear items with custom names.
* Press `F3 + H` to see advanced tooltips like technical item name and amount of NBT tags.
