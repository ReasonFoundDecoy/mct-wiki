All Pokemon rights belong to Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak.



Pokemon are collectable only! They cannot battle each other and there are no gyms.

Currently Gens I and II are live on the server. The plan is to release a new generation every 1-3 weeks. The reason behind waiting is to let the dust settle and make sure drop rates are acceptable.&#x20;

Exact drop rates are not public information. We have known rarities: common, uncommon, occasional, rare, and legendary. Shinies have their own drop rate system.

There are several ways you can obtain Pokemon on MCTantrum, including breaking blocks, fishing, killing mobs, and breeding.&#x20;

Breeding Pokemon means putting 2 specific pokemon in a crafting table that result in a hatchable egg. Right click with this egg to start the hatching process (see Custom Recipe Book). This is an official warning that you should only have **ONE** egg at a time in your inventory. If you end up losing an egg because you didn't heed this warning, no replacements will be given out, you'll have to breed more Pokemon.

You can evolve some Pokemon by trading with the NPC at spawn or with evolution stones. Buy evolution stones from the Pokeshop at spawn using [â‚½okedollars](../../economy/tokens-and-token-shop/rubokedollars.md), which are available in <mark style="color:blue;">**/tokenshop**</mark>.

Craft Pokeballs of different types by getting apricorns from leaves. Cook the apricorns in a smoker and craft with iron ingots and stone buttons. Find recipes for Pokeballs in the [Custom Recipe Book](../custom-crafting.md#pokemon-recipes).

Here's a quick video:

The following is a spreadsheet detailing how to find each Pokemon along with their rarites. Please take note at the bottom of the doc there is a sheet for each generation. This will be updated at each gen release to reflect newly added Pokemon.
