# Server Resource Pack

Upon first join, you will be prompted to decide if you want to use the resource pack.

_The server resource pack is not required but it is highly recommended to use it since it provides **a lot** of content._

If you've clicked "No" by accident, or change your mind and decide you want to use it, simply go back to your list of public servers, click on MCTantrum server, click the "Edit" button at the bottom of your screen, and change the resource pack setting to "Enabled".

Click on a category on the left to find out more about the topic.
