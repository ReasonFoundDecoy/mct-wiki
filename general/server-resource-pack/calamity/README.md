# Calamity

Calamity items come from the Calamity Mod in Terraria.

You can find these in game at <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp FalloutShelter**</mark>. Various NPCs throughout the structure trade a Calamity item in exchange for a Calamity Voucher <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/painting (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">, which can be bought from <mark style="color:blue;">**/tokenshop**</mark> for 25,000 tokens.

Please keep in mind that these are strictly textures. They all are netherite based. You can treat them like regular weapons and tools by enchanting, renaming, etc.
