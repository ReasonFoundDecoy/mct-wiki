# Brewery

Brewery is a plugin that allows you to take certain steps to brew 'alcoholic' and non-alcohol drinks.

All of the plugins own recipes give you the 'drunk' effect, to some degree.

Some of our custom brews give you buffs.

Unfortunately, Brewery plugin is no longer compatible with Exotic Garden (Slimefun).

## How to Brew

### Fermenting

1. Place a cauldron over fire and fill with water
2. Add ingredients to the cauldron by right-clicking them
3. Wait for the appropriate amount of time necessary for the recipe you're doing
4. Fill in glass bottles

{% hint style="info" %}
* You can right-click a cauldron with a clock to see how long ingredients have been boiling
* Particles may change color during the fermenting process for you to visually guage how long your ingredients have been boiling
{% endhint %}

### Distilling

Not all recipes require distilling.

1. Put the bottles you got from fermenting into a brewing stand
2. Use glowstone dust as the catalyst; this catalyst will never be consumed!
3. Distill brews for the amount of times the recipes calls for

### Aging

You can age your brew in barrels of varying sizes.

#### Minecraft Barrel

Slots: 6

Simply craft a vanilla Minecraft barrel and place your brews inside for the amount of time required by the recipe.

#### Small Barrel

Slots: 9

* Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape.
* Place a sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper line.
* After building and placing the sign, "Barrel created" will appear.

#### Big Barrel

Slots: 27

* Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape.
* Attach a Spigot (Fence).
* Place a sign at the top that has "Barrel" written on it in the upper line.
* The message "Barrel created" will appear.
* You may remove the sign from the Big Barrel after creating it.

Open the Barrel by clicking on it.

* Put the Bottles into the Barrels for aging.
* For every Minecraft Day, the brews will age a year.
* Depending on the recipe, the type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged brew.
* The vanilla Minecraft barrel is always of wood type oak.

### Sealing Brews

If you plan on selling brews at your shop, you may have to seal them first in order for SignShop to recognize them as being items of the same type.

* Craft a Brew Sealing Table.
* Putting a brew into the Sealing table will equalize it, making it equal to other brews that have been brewed similarly.
* Sealed brews cannot be aged or modified any further and they don't show their details anymore.

## Getting Sober

The following items sober you up incrementally as you consume them.

* Bread
* Milk
* Steak

The InstaCure item will sober you instantly. This item will be made more widely available as the Brewery Plugin becomes utilized more by players.

## Recipes

The following document shows the exact ingredients and recipe required for each possible brew.

Note that there are 2 sheets at the bottom of the spreadsheet, 1 for Brewery recipes, and 1 for MCTantrum (custom made) brews.
