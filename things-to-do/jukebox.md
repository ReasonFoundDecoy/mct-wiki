Open your music library and check out all the custom songs you have!

Play random songs, make playlists, control your volume, enable shuffle, and more!

Currently there are 137 songs. If you'd like to make a suggestion, find song files [here](https://github.com/thatcraniumguy/Songs/tree/master/NBS%20files), [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\_ZTht\_n1SkqgjkQLXYpBZ81pt3p\_IB0t), or anywhere else you find .nbs file types.

Just let an admin know and we can implement it for you!

Take note that these songs **must** be .nbs files for them to work.&#x20;
