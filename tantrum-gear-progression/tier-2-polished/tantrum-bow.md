{% hint style="info" %}
If you find that you cannot upgrade a newly obtained Tantrum Crossbow (tier 1 or tier 2), try shooting it once. Shooting a crossbow adds an NBT tag which is more compatible with upgrading.
{% endhint %}

Tantrum bow is a bow with 12 enchantments: 5 vanilla enchants and 7 AE enchants. It has 2 more enchants than its predecessor, Tantrum Crossbow.
