{% hint style="info" %}
You can put this item in a crafting table once to get a Precise Polished Earth-Grinder. Precise Polished Earth-Grinder is the same as a Polished Earth-Grinder except it doesn't have Trench or Smelting.&#x20;

This cannot be undone. Use caution when doing so as this does alter the item, rendering it not upgradable.
{% endhint %}

Polished Earth-Grinder is a netherite pickaxe with 9 enchantments: 4 vanilla enchants and 5 AE enchants. It has 1 more enchant than its predecessor, Tantrum Pick.
