# Tier 2 - Polished

## Upgrading from Tier 1 to Tier 2

Each item can be upgraded to Tier 2 as long as it hasn't been altered. To upgrade, you'll need to purchase a Polished Token from the Tantrum Shop (in server shop) and combine it with any Tier 1 item in an anvil. The item goes in the first slot and the Polished Token goes in the second slot.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you plan on upgrading again to Tier 3, you still **should not alter** these items in any way, shape, or form. Utilize mending for repairs, do not repair them in an anvil.
