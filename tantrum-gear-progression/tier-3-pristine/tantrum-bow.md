# Pristine Compound Crossbow

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Tantrum Crossbow.gif>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you find that you cannot upgrade a newly obtained Tantrum Crossbow (tier 1 or tier 2), try shooting it once. Shooting a crossbow adds an NBT tag which is more compatible with upgrading.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the crossbow NBT tag issue, upgrading it from Tier 2 to Tier 3 can still be done at <mark style="color:blue;">**/warp Info\_Island**</mark> but it has its own NPC: Crossbow Guy.
{% endhint %}

Tantrum bow is a bow with 14 enchantments: 5 vanilla enchants and 9 AE enchants. It has 2 more enchants than its predecessor, Polished Recurve Crossbow.
