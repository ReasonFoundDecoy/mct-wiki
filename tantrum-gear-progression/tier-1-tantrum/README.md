# Tier 1 - Tantrum

The progression path for Tantrum gear starts at the Tantrum Crate. To open the crate, you must buy a Tantrum Crate Key from the server shop. The cost of the Key is $750,000. There are 13 items in the crate:

* Tantrum Coif
* Tantrum Plate
* Tantrum Pants
* Tantrum Greaves
* Bobby the Rat
* Tantrum Blade
* Tantrum Bow
* Tantrum Crossbow
* Tantrum Trident
* Tantrum Pick
* Tantrum Shovel
* Tantrum Hoe
* Tantrum Pole

The crate has 100% chance to drop 1 of these items, each item having the same drop chance. This means that if you are looking to get a specific item from the crate, you may find yourself having to open it many times. If you have 2 of the same item, you can put them together in a crafting table to create a new Tantrum Crate Key.

The only item not available in the crate is the Tantrum Wings. These are created by combining a Tantrum Coif and an Elytra in a crafting table as a shapeless recipe.

**Do not alter** your Tantrum gear if you plan on upgrading!
{% endhint %}

It's very important to know that if you plan on upgrading your Tantrum gear, you must not alter it in any way, shape, or form. This includes changing the name, removing enchants, adding enchants, or even repairing it in an anvil. Utilize the high level of mending for repairs. Upgrading will only work on these items if they are their original form.
