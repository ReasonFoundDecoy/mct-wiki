{% hint style="info" %}
You can put this item in a crafting table once to get a Precise Tantrum Pick. Precise Tantrum Pick is the same as a Tantrum Pick except it doesn't have Trench or Smelting.&#x20;

This cannot be undone. Use caution when doing so as this does alter the item, rendering it not upgradable.
{% endhint %}

Tantrum Pick is a netherite pickaxe with 8 enchantments: 4 vanilla enchants and 4 AE enchants.
